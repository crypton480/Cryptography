Cryptography
============

All projects related to cryptograhy. 

1. A simple implementation of the RSA cryptosystem with (really) small prime numbers. Use files, RSA-sender and RSA-receiver. Use RSA-receiver to generate public keys, then use RSA-sender to encrypt the message and finally go back to RSA-receiver to decrypt the message.
